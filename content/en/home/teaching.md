  description = "My teaching combines platform theory and Chinese practice. Due to my work experience in Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Finance, I have participated in the design of many economic policies, especially corporate innovation policies. The experience within the system gave me a deep understanding of how the Chinese economic system works, which is of great significance for me to help students understand and participate in the digital economy under the framework of the Chinese system."
