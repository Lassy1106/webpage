Zhou Zhou received his Ph.D. in Information System from Boston University and B.A. in Financial Management from Peking University.

My research is dedicated to solving practical problems of China's platform companies based on platform theory. I am developing a theory of platform competitive advantage from the following two perspectives: 1) How platform strategy and design affect long-term platform moat; 2) Whether the platform harms social welfare when it uses platform strategy and design to enhance its competitive advantage. My research on innovation and entrepreneurship in the digital economy includes how to initiate a platform business and how to initiate a business on the platform.


His current research focuses on three main streams:

* Platform Competitive Advantage
* Cloud Computing and Governance
* Technology Entrepreneurship and Innovation

Several of my academic papers have been accepted by international academic conferences or under review by top international journals. Below, I combined the listed academic papers to explain how my research helps people understand platform strategy, design, and regulation in the Chinese context. These papers cover all major platforms in China, including Tencent, Alibaba, Douyin, Meituan, Kuaishou, Pinduoduo, Jingdong, Ctrip, DiDi, etc.
